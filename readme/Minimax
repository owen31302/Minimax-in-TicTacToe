Minimax


Set L = { n } //the unexpanded nodes in the tree

Let x be the 1st node on L. 

if (x == n && there is a value assigned to it){
	return this value
}else{
	if(x has been assigned a value vx){
		let p be the parent of x and vp the value currently assigned to p.
		if(p is a minimizing node){
			set vp  = min(vp, vx).
		}else if (p is a maximizing node){
			set vp = max(vp, vx)
		}
		Remove x from L and return to step 2.
	}else if(x has not been assigned a value and either x is a terminal node or we have decided not to expand the tree further){
		compute its value using the evaluation function. 
		Leave x on L 
		return to step 2.
	}else{
		if(x is a maximizing node){
			set vx to be –∞
		}else if (x is a minimizing node){
			set vx to be +∞
		}
		Add the children of x to the front of L 
		return to step 2.
	}
